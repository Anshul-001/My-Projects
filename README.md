8-Queens: The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. There are  4,426,165,368 combinations of queens to place but only 92 solutions. I implemented the Hill Climbing Search Algorithm to find the most optimal placements.

Battleship: A classic, simplified version of the Battleship board game.

Pokemon Clustering: Implemented hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) to a data set of publicly available Pokemon stats using SciPy.
